Unit 6 Problem 14<br>
Re: Refactoring <br>
</p>
<p>Refactoring is a way of rewriting code for the purpose of re-structuring code in a way that it fixes what is called "bad smell" but doesn't change the behavior of the code to the user. </p>


<p>Bad smell is something that could indicate a problem in the code even if it's working. 
Some of these bad smells could fall into a variety of categories, these being: bloaters, 
object-orientation abusers, change preventors, dispendables, and couplers. </p>

<p>Bloaters cause problems overtime by growing into large methods and classes. Often code is just added and nothing is done to the existing code causing massive expansion overtime. Object-orientation abusers are just the incorrect usage of principles - a good example would be when to use a switch statement instead of an if and vice-versa. Change preventers are things 
that you have to change in multiple places in your code. A good example of a solution to this is using a variable in stead of repeating code, that way if your variable changes it also changes everywhere it is used and it only has to be changed in one place. Dispensables is unecessary or redundant code. Getting rid of this kind of code would make your code shorter and more efficient. Lastly, Couplers refer to code that is so specific that it can't handle anything other than what it's expecting. </p>

<p>There are a variety of techniquies one could use to fix these issues. Ultimately, your code should be free of these errors and work the same if not better. Refactoring could be thought of 
like simplification of a mathematical expression. </p>
